when creating database use files included in the "Database files" folder the only change from project part 1 is that Actors and Directors tables have ALTER statments to add eye colour

database was made on postgresql 9.3 on linux using JDBC Driver postgresql-9.3-1104.jdbc41.jar on java 1.7

the included "delete.sql" will remove all the inserts from the database that were inserted by MyProject.java 

the description of the query is in a comment above the query in SQL1.sql and SQL2.sql the results for each query are directly under the queries in SQL1.sql and SQL2.sql as comments
